                        The first phase of infrastructural development at the main (Akoka) campus was completed in 1965. It consisted of two academic areas called Academic Group North and Academic Group South, the Dining Hall, Library, Administrative Block, the Central Concourse, staff quarters and students hostels.
                        The period between 1981 and 1991 may be described as a decade of economic leanness. The University seemed to have shared in the economic woes of the country as it helplessly watched many of its facilities fall into disrepair, and several employees leave its services for greener pastures elsewhere. There has been attempts to stem the tide of economic difficulties through the establishment of autonomous commercial outfits to boost the internally generated revenue, notably Unilag Consult and Unilag Enterprises (now Unilag Ventures)

                    <p>
                        The Hydraulic Research Laboratory was also constructed with a grant from the Government of the Netherlands and a donation of N30,000.00 from the Nigerian Ports Authority. The University of Lagos International School was established in 1981 and moved to its permanent site in October 1985. The Senate House Complex was completed in 1984.
                        Between 1995 and 2000, the University took several measures to shed the cloak of financial dependency on the Government by extending the range of its revenue generation activities and securing the generous financial involvement of individuals in restoring and promoting the image of the University. The completion or inauguration of the underlisted projects clearly suggest the pace at which the University was moving towards economic self-sufficiency, a reflection no doubt of resourcefulness and remarkable statecraft:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Construction of two new hostels at the Faculty of Education - Biobaku Saburi Hall for male students and Madam Kofo Ademola Hall for female students;</li>
                            <li>Construction of a massive water reservoir near the Department of MassCommunication;</li>
                            <li>Construction of a number of boreholes in the service area of the Main Campus;</li>
                            <li>Construction of the first Junior Staff quarters, Phase 1, along Lawani Road, off University Road, Abule-Oja;</li>
                            <li>Painting of the Faculty of Arts Building and of the old Halls of residence both on the Main Campus and at the College of Medicine;</li>
                            <li>Construction of a walkway linking the Faculty of Science with the Faculty ofEngineering;</li>
                            <li>Construction of the Unilag Consult Complex</li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Between 2000 and 2007, the University witnessed rapid transformation in terms of physical infrastructural development. This include extensions to the Faculty of Environmental Sciences; a new Faculty of Social Sciences Complex; new Hostel Blocks, renovation of old Hostels; a new Lecture Theatre donated by the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council, Chief Afe Babalola, SAN, LLD, CON; the new Post Graduate Hall donated by Dr. Erastus B. Akingbola; the new shopping mall on the Commercial Road; the rehabilitation of the erstwhile School of Radiography in Yaba to provide a campus for BA and FBA postgraduate programmes; the Drug Production of Unit of the Faculty of Pharmacy; the Laboratories for the School of Radiography; and a large (500 capacity) hostel for female students and  the Multipurpose Halls.

                    <p>
                        As an institution that has sought to remain relevant to its immediate environment, and to the country as a whole, because it is fully conscious of the socio-economic needs and realities of the nation, the University of Lagos has reviewed its structures and academic programmes on several occasions. The changes effected and the units affected are as outlined below:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Faculty of Pharmacy was created out of the College of Medicine in 1980. Also, the school of Radiography in Yaba was taken over by the University.</li>
                            <li>
                                The Department of Creative Arts was created in the Faculty of Arts in 1997. The Department was established to provide programmes in Music, Theatre Arts and Fine Arts leading to a B.A. Degree in Creative Arts. Its creation was tied to the phasing" out of the Centre for Cultural Studies and its activities, established in 1975, except those relating to auditoria management for which a committee will be responsible.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Department of African Languages and Literatures was renamed the Department of African and Asian Studies in 1997. The justification for the change of name was to reflect the incorporation of studies relevant to the cultures of African and Asian peoples. In 2005, the name of the Department was again changed to Department of Linguistic, African and Asian Studies.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Department of Modem European Languages was similarly first renamed Department of European Languages, but is now called Department of European Languages and Integration Studies.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The interdisciplinary collaboration which was implied in the School of Business and Social Studies between academic members of staff of the Departments of Business Administration and Economics but seemed to have ceased with the separation of the unit into two Faculties, resulted in the undesirable but consequential duplication of courses as reflected by FIN 411-Development Economics and BUS 427 - Industrial Economics. The problem was resolved in the decision that the Department of Economics should be responsible for the teaching of the two courses and other relevant courses after due consultations between the Faculties of Business Administration and Social Sciences.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the Faculty of Education, the Institute of Education which was initially set up to collaborate with the Faculty of Education and was assigned specific functions by the Senate of the University in November 1979 was phased out with the academic staff appropriately reassigned to departments of the Faculty for greater efficiency;
                            </li>
                            <li>The Engineering Analysis Unit of the Faculty of Engineering was phased out and all members of the academic staff moved to departments in the University based on their academic backgrounds.
                            </li>
                            <li>In the Faculty of Environmental Sciences, the following changes were made:
                                Department of Geography and Planning was changed to the Department of Geography, a name it had when it was a Department in the Faculty of Arts before it was transferred to Environmental Sciences in 1986. Presently, it is a Department in the Faculty of Social Sciences, its course codes reflect the Social Science base. The Department of Urban and Regional Planning was also resuscitated.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Department of Architecture and Design is now known as the Department of Architecture. </li>
                            <li>
                                In the Faculty of Science, two new departments were created out of the Department of Biological Sciences, namely: the Department of Botany and Microbiology and the Department of Zoology, Marine Biology and Fisheries between 1997 and 2010.
                                The Correspondence and Open Studies Institute (COSIT) was renamed Distance Learning Institute (DLI) in 1997. It has since December 1997 become autonomous, thus terminating its formal relationship with the Faculties of Business Administration, Science and Education. Consequently, it can employ its own staff within or outside the University for its programmes.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Between 2010 and 2020, the University has further evolved and created several new developments some of which are highlighted below:

The ventilator was named thus to emphasise the partnership between the University of Lagos (UNILAG) and Lagos State Science, Research and Innovation Council (LASRIC).  The Faculty of Pharmacy and Department of Chemistry produced sanitizers to curb the spread of the pandemic. Despite the pandemic, the University constructed new buildings and received some infrastructural donations:
